description: A list of African Americans in film and television
---

A while ago, I did a speech about the different types of devlopers there are. I wanted to use pictures of fictional characters who happen to be people of color.

It wasn't easy. There aren't many.

Once I got through the speech, I decided to compile a list of the African americans in film and television. I asked my friends and posted to a few boards. It's still not a lot, but I compiled them all and threw them in a [github repo](https://github.com/tobiaswright/black-programmers-in-film-and-television). Because why not, repretation matters right?

So without further ado, here is the list of hackers, programmers and developers in film and televison. It's a github repo, so feel free to submit a PR or shoot me an email for additions!
